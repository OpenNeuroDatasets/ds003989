This dataset contains unprocessed structural, diffusion and rs-functional MRI data acquired in 3 female
rhesus macaques. Each monkey underwent multiple sessions. For each session they were lightly 
anesthetized with Zoletil 100:10 mg/kg and Medetodimine 0.04 mg/kg. The animals were installed in sphinx position with their head restrained by a head-post.
Whole-brain images were acquired on a 3 Tesla clinical MR scanner (Philips Achieva) using a custom 8-channel phased array coil (RapidBiomed) specially designed to fit the skull of the animals.
